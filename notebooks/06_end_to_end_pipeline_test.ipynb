    "# Notebook 06: Test Approfondi du Pipeline de Bout en Bout\n",
    "\n",
    "Ce notebook est dédié à un test complet et une analyse détaillée du workflow \"MAKERS\" sur une requête utilisateur complexe. Nous allons observer les sorties intermédiaires des agents, le flux de décision, et la qualité de la synthèse finale. Nous explorerons également comment inspecter les états sauvegardés par le checkpointer MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prérequis :**\n",
    "* **Environnement de Base :** Avoir exécuté le notebook `00_setup_environment.ipynb` pour configurer l'environnement Conda, les dépendances Python, et s'assurer que le fichier `.env` à la racine du projet est correctement rempli avec toutes les configurations nécessaires.\n",
    "* **Base de Données MongoDB :**\n",
    "    * `MONGODB_URI` doit être correctement configuré dans `.env` et votre instance MongoDB doit être accessible. Ceci est fondamental pour le checkpointer LangGraph (`MongoDBSaver`) et les outils RAG.\n",
    "    * La base de données doit être peuplée (via `01_data_ingestion_and_embedding.ipynb` ou `scripts/run_ingestion.py`) avec des documents dont les embeddings ont été générés en utilisant le fournisseur spécifié par `DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` dans vos paramètres. Assurez-vous que les embeddings sont cohérents avec le fournisseur que vous comptez utiliser pour les requêtes dans ce notebook.\n",
    "* **Configuration des Fournisseurs de Modèles (dans `.env`) :** Le workflow `MAKERS` (exécuté par `run_makers_v2_1` dans ce notebook) utilisera les fournisseurs configurés via `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_PROVIDER` (pour les agents) et `DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` (pour la RAG). Vérifiez que les configurations correspondantes sont correctement en place :\n",
    "    * **Pour les LLMs des Agents (`DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_PROVIDER`) :**\n",
    "        * Si réglé sur `\"openai\"` : `OPENAI_API_KEY` et `DEFAULT_OPENAI_GENERATIVE_MODEL` sont requis.\n",
    "        * Si réglé sur `\"huggingface_api\"` : `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` et `HUGGINGFACE_REPO_ID` (pour le modèle génératif) sont requis.\n",
    "        * Si réglé sur `\"ollama\"` : `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` doit pointer vers votre instance Ollama en cours d'exécution, et que `OLLAMA_GENERATIVE_MODEL_NAME` doit être un modèle que vous avez téléchargé via `ollama pull` et qui est servi par Ollama.\n",
    "    * **Pour les Embeddings (`DEFAULT_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, utilisé par `RetrievalEngine` dans les outils) :**\n",
    "        * Si réglé sur `\"openai\"` : `OPENAI_API_KEY` et `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME` sont requis.\n",
    "        * Si réglé sur `\"huggingface\"` (local Sentence Transformers) : `HUGGINGFACE_EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME` doit être configuré (aucune clé API spécifique n'est généralement nécessaire pour cette partie).\n",
    "        * Si réglé sur `\"ollama\"` : `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` et `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME` (un modèle d'embedding approprié) sont requis et le modèle doit être servi par Ollama.\n",
    "* **Checkpointer LangGraph :** Le `MongoDBSaver` est utilisé par défaut par le workflow (`graph_app_v2_1` dans `main_workflow.py`) ; son bon fonctionnement dépend de la configuration correcte de `MONGODB_URI`."
