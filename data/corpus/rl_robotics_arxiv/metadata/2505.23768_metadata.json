    "summary": "We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15\nminihalos with masses ranging from $\\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\\ \\text{M}_{\\odot}$ at\nredshifts $z \\sim 17 - 20$, using the \\texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations\nincorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from\nthe state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required\nresolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the\nresolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\\sim 10^5$, reaching gas\nand dark matter particle masses of $0.2\\ \\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and $80\\\n\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion\nduring the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong\nturbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark\nmatter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach\nnumbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic\nturbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense\nclumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse\ninto the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a\ncommon feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy\nstar-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function\nof the first stars.",
