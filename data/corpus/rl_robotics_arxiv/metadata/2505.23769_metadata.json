    "summary": "Image-text models excel at image-level tasks but struggle with detailed\nvisual understanding. While these models provide strong visual-language\nalignment, segmentation models like SAM2 offer precise spatial boundaries for\nobjects. To this end, we propose TextRegion, a simple, effective, and\ntraining-free framework that combines the strengths of image-text models and\nSAM2 to generate powerful text-aligned region tokens. These tokens enable\ndetailed visual understanding while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities.\nThey can be directly applied to various downstream tasks, including open-world\nsemantic segmentation, referring expression comprehension, and grounding. We\nconduct extensive evaluations and consistently achieve superior or competitive\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods. Additionally,\nour framework is compatible with many image-text models, making it highly\npractical and easily extensible as stronger models emerge.
